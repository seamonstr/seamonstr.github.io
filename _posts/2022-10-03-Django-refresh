# Stuff to remember about Django

## Installation

* Install with pip: `pip install django; pip install djangorestframework`
* Django has a CLI with `django-admin` in python/bin

## Create a project

Create a project (the overall containing Django project) with `django-admin startproject <name>`. Will create 
* The project is a container for the indiviual apps
* Apps are WSGI callables that can be provided by django & other third parties
* ...and obv by us

The project directory is created at `./<name>`; it's a Python package containing:
* The ASGI and WSGI applications for the project
* A settings.py module for all the apps & middleware installed in the project, as well as other globale settings (BASEDIR, etc)

A ./manage.py file will be created: a script for adding apps to the project, building new module migrations, etc.

## Create an app

From the project's root directory (where `manage.py` is), do `python manage.py startapp <appname>`
* Creates a package `<appname>` off of `.` (sibling to the project package)
* Contains default config for the app: urls (used to map urls relative to the app), models (db config), etc

## Mapping URLs 

`<projectdir>/urls.py` has a `urlpatterns` list of `django.urls.Path` objects used to publish the URL set from within the apps.  Likewise, each app has a (by convention; can be any package name) `urls.py` which is a list of Path objects.

Each `Path` maps a url to one of:
1. *For the project level mapping:* The python module for the app; the module has a "url_patterns" list of its own, and an app_name.
1. *For the app level mapping:* A callable which is the view renderer, as declared in the apps `views.py`. The callable is called with a HttpRequest obj plus some kwargs from the route. Returns a HttpResponse obj. Also takes kwargs (from the URL?) and a name to use when referring to the URL fromm elsewhere.

So, map the app's URLs into the project with a string and the urls.py's module name.
Map each view at the app level with a string and the callable that renders the view.

So:

```
project
	manage.py
	/projectkg
		/urls.py
			urlpatterns - [Path] mapping strings to modules
	/appmodule
		/urls.py # Needs creating!
			urlpatterns - [Path] mapping strings to view callables
		/views.py # Contain the view callables

```

## Set up the DB and add some models
