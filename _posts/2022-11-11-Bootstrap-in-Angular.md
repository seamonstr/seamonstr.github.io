Title: Getting started with Bootstrap
---

## Installing Bootstrap

1. Install it with `npm install bootstrap`
2. Include it in the Angular project by editing `angular.json` and adding to `/projects/<proj-name>/architect/build/options/styles`: `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css`

Default styles immediately alter!
