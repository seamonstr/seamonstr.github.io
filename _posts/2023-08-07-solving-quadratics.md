# Completing the square

Solving a quadratic equation requires a square on one side of the equals, so that you can root both sides:

$$ (x+2)^2 = 9$$

$$ x + 2 = \pm 3 $$

$$ x = \pm 3 - 2 $$

When you have a square function, you have no issue with this; you can factor it into a $$ (ax + b)^2 $$ form.  When you don't, you have to add something to _make_ it square - hence, completing the square.

Say you have something that doesn't factor: $$x^2 + 3x + 2$$. What you want is to rephrase that in the form $$ (x + a) ^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2 $$, and we do that by adding the $$a^2$$ (disregarding the original constant for now).  

The co-efficient of $$x$$ is $$3$$.  To phrase that as $$2ax$$, $$a$$ is clearly $$3 \over 2$$.  So, we can make that square by adding $$( {3 \over 2} )^2$$ but also subtracting it:

$$ x^2 + 2 \cdot {3 \over 2} x + ({3 \over 2})^2 - ({3 \over 2})^2 + 1 $$

This factorises as:
$$(x + {3 \over 2} )^2 - ({3 \over 2})^2 + 1 = (x + {3 \over 2} )^2 - {5 \over 4 } $$, which is a square term.
