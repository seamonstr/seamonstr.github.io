# Sequences and series

Sequences often have a function that is the same as the sequence. In this, $$n$$ is the $$x$$/input value, and the value is the $$y$$.

$$\Bigl\{ { {n + 1} \over {n^2} } \Bigr\}_{n=1}^\infty \equiv f(n)={ {n + 1} \over {n^2} }$$

## Notation

Notations for a sequence are:
1. $$\{ a_1, a_2, a_3, a_..., a_n \}$$ .
2. $$\{ a_n \}$$ - denotes the complete sequence where the starting value is implied
3. $$\{a_n\}^\infty_{n=1}$$ - n from 1 to infinity

## Negative and fractional exponents

Negative and fractional components cannot be expressed as finite polynomials; they're all series.  This video explains using the Taylor series to solve:
